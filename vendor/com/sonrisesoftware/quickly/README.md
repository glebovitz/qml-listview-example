Quickly
=======

Quickly is a QML/JS library offering additional classes and methods that are part of the ES6 JS spec that QML's JS framework does not have. In addition, it offers several of the core modules that Node.js has.

The Quickly library is designed to be used with [QMLify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qmlify) to offer a Node.js-like ES6 environment for Javascript used in QML. However, in can be used by itself to add the additional classes, methods, and core modules to a QML project.

Check out the [documentation](http://quickly.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) for more details, usage, and API documentation.

### Installation

    import QtQuick 2.4

            var set = new Polyfills.Set()
            set.add(4)
            set.add(2)
            set.add(4)
            console.log(set.size) // Prints 2

            var promise = new Promise.Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
                resolve("Why again did we need a promise here?")
            }).then(function(result) {
                console.log(result)
            })
